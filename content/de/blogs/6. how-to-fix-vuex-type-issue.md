### Introduction

In recent versions of our Vue projects, when adding Vuex, you might encounter type errors or issues with Vuex types not being found. Fortunately, this issue can be easily fixed.

### How to Fix That Issue

1. **Create a `vuex.d.ts` File**

   Create a file named `vuex.d.ts` inside your project.

2. **Add the Following Code**

   Paste the following code into the `vuex.d.ts` file:

   ```ts
   declare module "vuex" {
     export * from "vuex/types/index.d.ts";
     export * from "vuex/types/helpers.d.ts";
     export * from "vuex/types/logger.d.ts";
     export * from "vuex/types/vue.d.ts";
   }

   ```

3. **You're All Set**

Thatâ€™s it! Your Vuex types should now work correctly in your project.

### Conclusion
By following these simple steps, you can resolve the issues with Vuex types in your Vue project. If you continue to face issues, ensure that all your dependencies are up-to-date and check the Vuex and TypeScript documentation for additional guidance.
